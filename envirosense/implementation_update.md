# EnviroSense Implementation Update - May 20, 2025

## Directory Reorganization

The project has been successfully reorganized to follow the three-tier architecture defined in the Master Development Plan v2.1:

### 1. Simulation Engine (`/simulation_engine`)

The standalone simulation engine components have been moved from `/core` to `/simulation_engine` to maintain a clear separation of concerns:

- `/simulation_engine/time_series` - Time series generation and pattern modeling
- `/simulation_engine/physics` - Environmental physics and spatial modeling
- `/simulation_engine/chemical` - Chemical properties and behaviors
- `/simulation_engine/exposure` - Exposure tracking and dose-response calculations
- `/simulation_engine/biometrics` - Biometric signal generation
- `/simulation_engine/physiological` - Physiological response modeling
- `/simulation_engine/correlation` - Correlation framework for relating exposures to responses

### 2. Core Platform (`/core_platform`)

The infrastructure and APIs that build upon the simulation engine:

- `/core_platform/temporal_correlation` - Advanced temporal correlation analysis
  - `alignment.py` - Time series alignment algorithms
  - `window_analysis.py` - Moving window correlation analysis
- `/core_platform/visualization` - Visualization components for data presentation
- `/core_platform/adapters.py` - Adapter interface for simulation engine integration

### 3. Grid Guardian Hardware (`/grid_guardian`)

Framework for the physical hardware, firmware, and backend integration.

## Integration Approach

To maintain clean architecture boundaries, we've implemented:

1. **Adapter Pattern**: The `SimulationEngineAdapter` class in `/core_platform/adapters.py` provides a unified interface for accessing simulation engine components and ensures version compatibility.

2. **Organization Map**: The `organization_map.md` file documents the architectural structure and component organization.

3. **Project Status Tracking**: The `project_status.md` file tracks the current implementation status and next steps.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the Temporal Correlation System implementation:
   - Implement delayed response modeling
   - Implement cumulative effect modeling

2. Start development on Analysis and Insight Generation components

3. Implement testing framework updates to reflect the new architecture

## Notes on Implementation

- All internal core platform components should access simulation engine components through the adapter to maintain architectural boundaries
- Direct imports of simulation engine components are discouraged to ensure proper versioning and dependency management
- The adapter is designed as a singleton instance to be used throughout the core platform
