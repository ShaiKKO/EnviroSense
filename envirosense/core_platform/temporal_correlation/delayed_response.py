Delayed Response Modeling for Temporal Correlation.

This module implements delayed response modeling capabilities for the EnviroSense
Temporal Correlation System, allowing for analysis of time-lagged relationships 
between environmental exposures and physiological or sensor responses.

The implementation is based on research from:
- Multi-output Gaussian Process (MOGP) models for temporal prediction
- Dynamic Time Warping for temporal alignment with delays
- Temporal pattern recognition techniques in sensor fusion
- Dose-response temporal dynamics with variable latency

Classes:
    DelayedResponseModel: Core class for modeling responses with variable delay
    TemporalPattern: Enumeration of different temporal response patterns
    CompoundDelayProfile: Class representing compound-specific delay characteristics
    PathwayResponseTiming: Class for modeling pathway-dependent timing variations
