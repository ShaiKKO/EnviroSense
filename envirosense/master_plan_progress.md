## Integration Architecture

The adapter pattern has been implemented to maintain clean architectural boundaries between the tiers:

- `SimulationEngineAdapter` in `/core_platform/adapters.py` provides a unified interface for Core Platform components to interact with Simulation Engine components
- Version compatibility checking is implemented to ensure proper component interactions

## Key Achievements

1. ✓ Complete reorganization of simulation components into the Simulation Engine tier
2. ✓ Implementation of core platform temporal correlation components
3. ✓ Delayed Response Modeling implementation based on peer-reviewed research
4. ✓ Initial visualization framework
5. ✓ Clean architecture boundaries with adapter pattern
6. ✓ Comprehensive documentation (organization_map.md, implementation_update.md)

## Current Focus Areas

1. ⧗ Complete Temporal Correlation System implementation (3/5 subtasks completed)
2. ⧗ Start Analysis and Insight Generation component development
3. ⧗ Continue Grid Guardian hardware integration

## Next Major Milestones

1. Implement Advanced Pattern Recognition for Temporal Correlation (task 1.2.4)
2. Complete Core Platform Integration APIs
3. Implement Parameter Control System
4. Begin Grid Guardian hardware implementation

## Timeline Status

The project is proceeding according to schedule with all Tier 1 components complete and Tier 2 components in progress.
