# EnviroSense Implementation Update: 2025-05-21

## Completed Components

### 1. Uncertainty Propagation System

We have implemented a comprehensive uncertainty propagation framework in `envirosense/core_platform/uncertainty/` that provides:

- Parameter-level uncertainty representation with various probability distributions
- Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation for arbitrary functions
- Analytical (first-order) uncertainty propagation using linearization
- Automatic sensitivity analysis to identify key parameters
- Confidence interval calculations for predictions
- Special support for cumulative effect modeling

Key files:
- `propagation.py`: Core implementation of uncertainty propagation algorithms
- `__init__.py`: Package exports and public API
- `README.md`: Documentation and usage examples

### 2. Dose-Response Curve Fitting System

We have implemented an extensive dose-response modeling system in `envirosense/core/exposure/dose_response/models/` that provides:

- Multiple dose-response curve types (linear, logistic, log-logistic, exponential, probit, Hill, piecewise linear)
- Statistical model comparison and selection
- Parameter estimation with confidence intervals, standard errors, and p-values
- Effective dose calculations with uncertainty bounds
- Visual representation of fitted curves with confidence bands
- Seamless integration with the uncertainty propagation system

Key files:
- `curve_fitting.py`: Core implementation with all model types and statistical features
- `__init__.py`: Package exports and public API
- `README.md`: Documentation and usage examples

### 3. Integration Examples

We've created a comprehensive example demonstrating the integration of these two systems:

- `envirosense/core/exposure/dose_response/examples/uncertainty_example.py`: Shows how to fit dose-response curves and propagate parameter uncertainty through the models, including:
  - Generating synthetic data with known parameters
  - Fitting dose-response models to the data
  - Converting fitted parameters to uncertain parameters
  - Propagating uncertainty through dose-response functions
  - Comparing Monte Carlo and analytical propagation methods
  - Calculating effective doses with confidence intervals
  - Visualizing uncertainty in dose-response relationships
  - Performing sensitivity analysis to identify key parameters

## Alignment with Master Plan

These implementations directly support the following objectives from the master plan:

1. **Exposure Assessment with Uncertainty Quantification**:
   - The dose-response curve fitting system provides robust exposure-response models
   - The uncertainty propagation framework quantifies confidence in model predictions
   - Together they enable probabilistic risk assessment rather than deterministic estimates

2. **Individual Sensitivity Variations**:
   - The uncertainty propagation system supports individual-level variation modeling
   - Parameter distributions can represent population variability
   - Different sensitivity profiles can be modeled and compared

3. **Environmental Simulation with Confidence Intervals**:
   - All model predictions now include statistical confidence intervals
   - Sensitivity analysis identifies key factors driving uncertainty
   - Decision-making can consider the full probability distribution of outcomes

## Integration Interfaces

The implemented components have clean interfaces that integrate with:

1. **Time Series Analysis**: Temporal patterns of exposure can be combined with dose-response models to predict cumulative effects over time.

2. **Physiological Response Modeling**: Dose-response curves directly feed into physiological response simulations with propagated uncertainty.

3. **Exposure Assessment**: Concentration and duration data can be processed through these models to estimate health risks with confidence intervals.

4. **Spatial Modeling**: Uncertainty in spatial concentrations can be propagated through dose-response functions.

## Next Steps

Building on these foundations, potential next priorities include:

1. Implementing combined exposure modeling for multiple substances
2. Adding Bayesian parameter estimation for more complex uncertainty structures
3. Creating specialized models for specific exposure types (inhalation, dermal, etc.)
4. Developing calibration tools to adjust models based on real-world data
5. Integrating machine learning approaches for complex dose-response relationships
