## 3. Synthesis of Cumulative Effects

### 3.1. Interconnectedness of Fire and Energy Systems
    *   Wildfires pose significant risks to energy infrastructure (transmission lines, power plants).
    *   Energy policies and choices (e.g., biomass utilization) can influence fire regimes and forest health.
    *   Climate change, driven by energy consumption patterns, exacerbates fire risk and intensity.

### 3.2. Challenges in Prediction and Management
    *   Accuracy of fuel maps and fire behavior models is crucial but challenging, especially with changing climate and landscapes.
    *   Integrating diverse datasets (spectral, biophysical, imagery) improves model performance but requires sophisticated data fusion techniques.
    *   Label impurity in training data for machine learning models can affect accuracy.

### 3.3. Future Directions
