ABSTRACT
The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in environmental monitoring offers accurate disaster forecasts,
pollution source detection, and comprehensive air and water quality monitoring. This article provides an
overview of the value of environmental monitoring, the challenges of conventional methods, and potential AIbased solutions. Several significant AI applications in environmental monitoring are highlighted, showcasing
their contributions to effective environmental management. AI technologies enhance environmental monitoring
by enabling better understanding, prediction, and mitigation of environmental risks. However, realizing the full
potential of AI faces hurdles such as a shortage of specialized AI experts in the environmental sector and challenges related to data access, control, and privacy. These issues are more pronounced in regions with developing
technological infrastructure. The paper advocates for proactive data governance measures by governments to
protect sensitive information. Despite these challenges, the future of AI in environmental monitoring remains
promising, with advancements in AI algorithms, data collection techniques, and computing power expected to
further improve accuracy and efficiency in pollution monitoring and management.
Introduction
The essential process of environmental monitoring entails the systematic observation, measurement, and evaluation of the natural environment and all of its components. Monitoring the environment’s
current condition and identifying any changes that can be harmful to the
ecosystem or public health is its main goal (Artiola et al., 2004).
Traditional environmental monitoring techniques include statistical
analysis, laboratory analysis, and manual sampling (Zhang, 2024). Unfortunately, these approaches have limitations, such as high costs, prolonged procedures, and poor accuracy.
The efficiency of conventional environmental monitoring techniques
is constrained by several issues. The expense of using these procedures is
one of the biggest obstacles. The costs associated with manual sampling
and laboratory analysis are high and include skilled employees, equipment, and chemicals (Dressing et al., 2016; Ditria et al., 2022). As a
result, environmental monitoring programs often have a narrow focus,
use small sample sizes, and do not provide a comprehensive picture of
the state of the environment. The time-intensiveness of traditional
methods is another significant problem (Thomson et al., 2011; Ceccato
et al., 2014; Dressing et al., 2016). Decision-making and emergency
response in the case of natural catastrophes or pollution crises can be
delayed by manual sampling and laboratory analysis, which might take
weeks or even months to generate results. Additionally, the subjectivity
of human observation and the potential for human error limit the accuracy of traditional environmental monitoring techniques (Hameed
et al., 2017). Human interpretation required for manual sampling and
laboratory analysis can lead to inconsistent data collection and

processing.
Furthermore, the utilization of advanced technologies and the
presence of adequately trained technical personnel necessary for precise
environmental monitoring are frequently impeded by cost limitations
and a scarcity of qualified individuals (Cordier et al., 2021). Consequently, achieving regular monitoring becomes an arduous task,
particularly in regions with limited resources (Li et al., 2020). This is
especially pronounced in areas lacking technological infrastructure and
expertise (Li et al., 2020).
Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a crucial integration in
environmental monitoring endeavors,seeking to enhance the objectivity
of results and improve accessibility to regions suffering from limited
resources. AI, a subfield of computer science, focuses on creating algorithms and computer programs that can perform activities like sensing,
reasoning, learning, and decision-making that would ordinarily require
human intellect (Rodgers, 2020; Sarker, 2021a, b). Large data sets can
be analyzed using AI, which has proven useful for identifying patterns
and making precise predictions (Duan et al., 2019; UNEP.org, 2022). In
environmental monitoring, AI has been applied in various areas,
including the prediction of natural disasters, monitoring air and water
quality, and identifying pollutants (Subramaniam et al., 2022). Table 1
offers a comparative analysis of AI methods versus traditional approaches in terms of accuracy, speed, cost, scalability, data integration,
maintenance, and environmental impact. It underscores the significant
advantages of AI in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of environmental monitoring while highlighting the potential initial costs and
the importance of considering long-term benefits.
For instance, AI models such as Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) are used for image-based environmental monitoring tasks like
detecting deforestation and identifying wildlife (Bidari and Chickerur,
2024). Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have been applied to predict
harmful algal blooms in lakes, demonstrating the model’s capability to
handle high-dimensional data (Li et al., 2020a). Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are utilized for time series forecasting, such as predicting
flood events based on historical rainfall data (Chen et al., 2020).
In addition, the utilization of advanced technologies and the presence of adequately trained technical personnel necessary for precise
environmental monitoring are frequently impeded by cost limitations
and a scarcity of qualified individuals. Consequently, the attainment of
regular monitoring becomes an arduous task, particularly in regions of
the world facing resource constraints, particularly in the global south.
Therefore, in recent years, AI has emerged as a crucial integration in
environmental monitoring endeavors,seeking to enhance the objectivity
of results and improve accessibility to regions suffering from limited
resources. This narrative review aims to comprehensively explore and
evaluate the current state of AI technologies implemented in key areas of
environmental monitoring, shedding light on their efficacy and potential
implications for future research and practical applications.
AI models for environmental monitoring
When choosing an AI model for environmental monitoring, it is
essential to consider factors such as data availability, computational
resources, and expertise. Some AI models require large amounts of data
and computational power to train, while others can be trained on
smaller datasets with less computational expense (Zhou et al., 2020).
SVMs are well-suited for handling high-dimensional data and learning
complex relationships between variables (Manikandan and Abirami,
2021). SVMs can be used with various data types, including images and
text. For instance, SVMs have been used effectively for image classification tasks, such as detecting deforestation and identifying wildlife
(Zagajewski et al., 2021). They are also applied in natural language
processing to extract information from environmental reports (Meza
et al., 2019). Support Vector Regression (SVR), a variant of SVM, is used
for regression problems in environmental monitoring, offering an
effective solution for predicting environmental control parameters (Ye

Decision trees are relatively simple to train and interpret, making
them accessible for various data types. They are commonly used for
tasks like detecting and monitoring deforestation, monitoring air quality, and water quality (De Bem et al., 2020; Tarazona and Miyasiro-Lopez, ´ 2020). However, decision trees can be prone to overfitting,
especially when handling complex, noisy data, and may not perform as
well on image recognition or natural language processing tasks
(Buntine, 2020).
Random forests are an ensemble learning method that combines the
predictions of multiple decision trees. They are more robust to overfitting than individual decision trees and can handle various data types,
including images and text (El-Magd et al., 2022). Random forests are
commonly used for image classification, natural language processing,
and time series forecasting tasks in environmental monitoring. Despite
their robustness, random forests can be computationally intensive and
require substantial memory and processing power.
CNNs are well-suited for image classification and tasks involving
spatial data. CNNs can learn complex patterns from images without
explicit programming, making them ideal for detecting deforestation
and identifying wildlife (Zhang et al., 2022). However, CNNs can be
computationally expensive to train and require large amounts of labeled
data. Training CNN models can be challenging due to the lack of annotated datasets for visual recognition. Pre-training models using data
from similar domains can mitigate this issue (Ghorbani and Behzadan,
2021).
RNNs are suitable for tasks involving sequential data, such as time
series forecasting and natural language processing. RNNs can learn longterm dependencies in data, making them effective for predicting
extreme weather events and extracting information from environmental
reports (Haq et al., 2022). However, RNNs can be computationally
expensive to train and require large datasets. Advanced models like
CDLSTM (Convolutional Deep Long Short-Term Memory) have been
developed for more accurate climate change forecasting and groundwater storage change modeling.

Hybrid models combine the strengths of machine learning and deep
learning models, offering high accuracy and robustness. They are used
for environmental monitoring tasks that require capturing complex
nonlinear interactions between input and output variables (Zaresefat
and Derakhshani, 2023). While hybrid models can be more complex to
train and interpret, they provide superior performance for high-stakes
environmental monitoring tasks. Highly relevant work, such as the
development of Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Deep
Neural Networks (SMOTEDNN) for air pollution forecasting and AQI
classification, further exemplifies the potential of AI in this field (Zhao
et al., 2024).
Table 2 below presents a variety of AI models used for environmental
monitoring. Each AI model has its strengths and limitations, making it
important to choose the right model for the specific task at hand. SVMs
and SVR are effective for high-dimensional data and regression tasks but
can be computationally expensive. Decision trees are simple and interpretable but prone to overfitting (Costa and Pedreira, 2023; Wan et al.,
2020). Random forests offer robustness and versatility but require significant computational resources (Boateng et al., 2020). CNNs excel in
image-based tasks but need large labeled datasets and substantial
computational power. RNNs are effective for sequential data but also
demand high computational resources and advanced models like
CDLSTM for complex forecasting tasks (Li et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2023).
Hybrid models provide the highest accuracy and robustness but are
complex to train and interpret.
Principles of AI models
AI modeling is underpinned by a set of guiding principles that form
the bedrock of developing intelligent systems (Bommasani et al., 2021;
Palakurti and Kolasani, 2024). These principles provide a roadmap for
the creation of AI models that can tackle intricate problems, automate
tasks, and make informed decisions. At its core, AI modeling relies on the
principle of data-driven learning (Wang et al., 2022). The pivotal role of
data in AI modeling cannot be overstated. AI models learn from extensive datasets, sifting through data to discern patterns, trends, and relationships. For example, in air quality monitoring, AI models analyze
data from various sensors to predict pollution levels and identify
pollution sources, as demonstrated by the SMOTEDNN model for air
pollution forecasting and AQI classification (Goel et al., 2024; Haq,
2022). In another case, AI models are used to monitor water quality by
analyzing parameters such as pH, turbidity, and nitrate levels to predict
contamination events and ensure safe drinking water (Ahmed et al.,
2020; Jayaraman et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2019). Machine learning and
deep learning algorithms are prominent in this regard, as they harness
the power of data to make predictions and decisions (Rasool et al., 2023;
Tabesh, 2022).
Generalization is another cardinal principle of AI modeling. It implies that AI models must be able to extend their learning from specific
datasets to make predictions or decisions in a broader context. This
flexibility ensures that AI models can handle new, unseen data effectively (Q.-V. Pham et al., 2020; Sarker, 2022). A practical application of
this principle can be seen in the CDLSTM model, which generalizes from
historical climate data to forecast future climate changes (Stjelja et al.,
2022), thereby aiding in environmental monitoring and
decision-making. Similarly, in wildlife conservation, AI models trained
on data from camera traps can generalize to detect and track species
across different habitats, aiding in the protection of endangered species
(Curry et al., 2021; Norouzzadeh et al., 2018; Schneider et al., 2019).
Feature engineering is a crucial practice that underscores the need to
select relevant features or variables from the data. AI models demand
meaningful input features to make accurate predictions. Feature engineering encompasses data preprocessing, feature selection, and transformation to enhance model performance (Dong and Liu, 2018). For
instance, in water quality monitoring, selecting appropriate features
such as pH, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen levels is essential for
accurate predictions (Chen et al., 2020; Ouma et al., 2020). In agricultural monitoring, features like soil moisture, temperature, and crop
health indices are engineered to predict yield and detect pest infestations (Hassan et al., 2022).
A delicate balance between model complexity and simplicity is
essential. AI models must neither be overly complex nor too simplistic.
Overly complex models can lead to overfitting, where they perform
exceptionally well on training data but fail to generalize to new data
(Kernbach and Staartjes, 2022; Teney et al., 2022). Conversely, overly
simplistic models may not capture intricate patterns in the data. In
practice, achieving this balance can be observed in environmental
monitoring models that use random forests, where ensemble methods
help avoid overfitting while maintaining robustness in predictions.
Similarly, in urban planning, AI models that predict traffic flow and
congestion must balance complexity and simplicity to provide reliable
forecasts without overfitting to historical traffic patterns (Kernbach and
Staartjes, 2022; Sayed et al., 2023). Moreover, AI models should adhere
to the principle of continuous learning. They should be designed to
adapt and evolve over time, learning from new data to improve their
performance and relevance. For example, AI systems used in deforestation monitoring continually learn from satellite images to update their
models and provide more accurate assessments (Masolele et al., 2021;
Yang et al., 2022). In healthcare, AI models that monitor disease outbreaks evolve with new epidemiological data, enhancing their predictive accuracy and response strategies (Malik et al., 2021; Zeng et al.,
2021).
Finally, model interpretability is of paramount importance. Understanding how and why an AI model reaches a specific decision is vital for
user trust and addressing ethical concerns (Bedu´e and Fritzsche, 2022;
Omrani et al., 2022). Interpretable models are particularly critical in
fields such as healthcare and law. In the context of environmental
monitoring, interpretable models help stakeholders understand the
factors contributing to pollution, thereby facilitating informed
decision-making and policy development. For instance, decision trees
used in environmental monitoring can provide clear, interpretable rules
that explain how specific environmental conditions lead to certain
outcomes (Ryo et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022). Similarly, in energy
management, interpretable AI models can help utilities understand energy consumption patterns and optimize grid operations.
Shortcomings of AI models
In the realm of AI for environmental monitoring, alongside its
numerous advantages, there exist several noteworthy shortcomings and
challenges that must be recognized (Shalu and Singh, 2023). An
awareness of these limitations is essential for the responsible and
informed development of AI models. Data dependency is a prominent
limitation. AI models rely heavily on the quality and quantity of data.
Insufficient or biased data can result in poor model performance or
algorithmic bias, which may perpetuate discrimination. For example, if
an AI model for air quality monitoring is trained primarily on data from
urban areas, it may not perform well in rural settings, leading to inaccurate predictions and potentially harmful policy decisions (Almalawi
et al., 2022; Krupnova et al., 2022; Rowley and Karakus¸, 2023).
Overfitting poses a significant challenge in AI modeling. It occurs
when a model learns the training data too well, leading to poor generalization to new, unseen data. Striking a balance in model complexity is
key to mitigating this issue. In practical terms, an overfitted model might
accurately predict water quality in the specific rivers it was trained on
but fail to generalize to other rivers with different characteristics
(Fern´
andez del Castillo et al., 2022; Malek et al., 2022). Interpretability
is another vexing challenge, particularly in the context of deep learning
models. These models are often described as "black boxes" due to their
lack of transparency (Abdallah et al., 2020). The ability to comprehend
how and why an AI model reaches a particular decision is crucial for
building user trust, but it remains an ongoing challenge. For instance,
D.B. Olawade et al. Hygiene and Environmental Health Advances 12 (2024) 100114
4
stakeholders might be reluctant to act on AI-driven deforestation alerts if
they cannot understand the underlying reasons for the model’s predictions (Hodel, 2023; Osman, 2024).
Furthermore, resource intensiveness is another constraint. Training
and running complex AI models demand substantial computational resources, which can be a barrier for smaller organizations and developing
countries (Dwivedi et al., 2021; Kar et al., 2021). This disparity can
exacerbate existing inequalities, where only well-resourced entities can
leverage advanced AI technologies effectively. Conversely, ethical concerns are a growing issue in AI development. AI models can inadvertently reinforce existing biases present in the training data. Ensuring
fairness and addressing ethical concerns is a significant challenge,
particularly in applications where fairness and non-discrimination are
paramount (Olaoye, 2024; Singh, 2021). For example, if an AI model for
disaster response prioritizes areas based on biased historical data, it
might unfairly neglect vulnerable communities.
On the other hand, security risks are a real concern. AI models are
susceptible to adversarial attacks, where small, carefully crafted changes
to input data can deceive the model (Baniecki and Biecek, 2024;
Chakraborty et al., 2021). Ensuring security and robustness against such
attacks is a pressing concern in AI development (Zhang et al., 2020). A
notable example is the manipulation of AI systems in smart grids, where
adversarial attacks could disrupt power distribution and cause significant economic damage (Nguyen et al., 2020). Lastly, the environmental
impact of AI models is becoming more evident. Large-scale AI training
consumes significant energy resources, contributing to environmental
concerns (Ahmad et al., 2021). The carbon footprint of AI models and
the need for more energy-efficient solutions are increasingly pressing
issues. For instance, training a single large AI model can generate as
much carbon emissions as five cars over their lifetimes, highlighting the
need for sustainable AI practices (Nishant et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2022).
Practical Scenarios of AI in Environmental Monitoring
This section of the review will highlight practical instances AI has
been employed to monitor and protect environmental health and safety.
Natural disaster prediction
Natural disasters including hurricanes, earthquakes, and wildfires
pose a serious threat to property around the world. Natural disasters can
have a devastating effect, destroying large portions of infrastructure,
upsetting the economy, and putting human lives in peril (Rongxing,
2021). AI has garnered increasing attention in recent years for its potential to foresee natural disasters and lessen their effects. AI-based solutions can deliver precise, real-time data on natural disasters, assisting
authorities in creating efficient response plans and lowering the dangers
to public safety (Pyayt et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2021). Natural disasters
including earthquakes, tsunamis, and storms have been predicted using
AI. AI is used to anticipate natural disasters by evaluating data from
many sources, such as satellite imagery, seismic sensors, and meteorological forecasts, to find patterns and estimate the risk that a disaster will
occur (Marcin, 2023). AI-based natural disaster prediction can give
communities and emergency responders early warning, enabling them
to plan and act appropriately.
AI is used to anticipate natural disasters by analyzing data from a
variety of sources, such as satellite images, weather data, and historical
records, to find patterns and trends that may point to an imminent
natural disaster (Marcin, 2023). The presence of smoke, ash, or other
signs of a wildfire are examples of minor changes in the environment
that may signal the beginning of a natural disaster (Sebastian and
Natalija, 2017). AI algorithms can also learn to recognize changes in
temperature, humidity, or wind patterns.
Using AI to predict natural disasters provides a number of advantages
over more conventional approaches. In the beginning, AI-based systems
have the capacity to analyze enormous volumes of data from numerous
sources, giving an accurate picture of the environment in real-time. This
enables authorities to plan ahead for potential natural disasters and act
quickly to address them (Guo et al., 2022). Additionally, compared to
conventional approaches, AI-based systems can collect and analyze data
with higher accuracy and precision. This can lower the possibility of
mistakes and inconsistent results, increasing the accuracy of forecasts
for natural disasters. Inevitably, AI-based systems can offer unique solutions for various natural disaster locales and types. AI algorithms can
create tailored interventions, such as evacuations, warning systems, or
disaster relief activities, to lower the risks and impact of these disasters
by evaluating data from certain areas and types of natural disasters
(Chowdhury and Sadek, 2012).
There are numerous uses for AI-based natural disaster prediction
across various sectors. Emergency management is one of the key uses. AI
systems are able to assess data on natural catastrophes and create
specialized plans for emergency responses such as evacuations, search
and rescue operations, and disaster relief (Jeff, 2020). Planning and
managing urban areas is another application. In order to lower the risks
and effects of natural disasters, AI algorithms can analyze data on disasters and create specialized solutions for urban planning and design.
For instance, AI algorithms can suggest modifications to zoning regulations, infrastructure development, and construction regulations to
lower the likelihood of flooding, earthquakes, or wildfires. The prediction of natural disasters using AI is also useful for risk management and
insurance (Jeff, 2020). AI algorithms can create specialized insurance
policies and risk management plans to lower the costs and effects of
natural disasters by analyzing data on risk factors and disasters (Dailey
and Mamane, 2021; Eling et al., 2022).
Notwithstanding the advantages of AI-based natural disaster prediction, a number of issues need to be resolved in order to assure its
successful application. The quality of the data used for analysis represents one of the major obstacles. For AI systems to make precise predictions and choices, they need accurate and trustworthy data.
Inadequate data quality can result in inaccurate predictions and choices,
which could have a negative impact on property and public safety
(Cort`es et al., 2000; Wei, 2021; Krupnova et al., 2022; Marcin, 2023).
The availability of data presents another difficulty. It is challenging to
create precise and trustworthy AI-based prediction systems because
there are many regions of the world with insufficient data on natural
disasters. In addition to technological constraints, political and economic issues can also have an impact on the availability of data. Finally,
it is important to think about the ethical implications of AI-based natural
disaster prediction. The use of AI to anticipate natural disasters raises
concerns regarding privacy, data ownership, and the possibility of data
exploitation. To ensure the ethical use of AI for predicting natural disasters, ethical regulations and guidelines must be developed
(Coeckelbergh, 2021; Saheb, 2022; Marcin, 2023). Table 3 shows a
number of instances where AI was employed in the prediction of natural
disasters.
Air quality monitoring
A significant environmental issue that impacts quality of life, economic growth, and public health is air pollution. Both locally and
globally, air pollution negatively affects health, contributing to serious
conditions like cancer, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory ailments
(Ghorani-Azam, 2016; Manisalidis et al., 2020). To address this issue,
there has been increased interest in using AI for air quality monitoring.
Systems powered by AI can deliver precise, real-time data on air quality,
assisting authorities in creating efficient policies and interventions to
minimize air pollution. AI-based recommendations can guide responses
when air quality is hampered, ensuring timely actions to protect public
health. Machine learning algorithms analyze data from various sources,
including air quality sensors, satellite imaging, and weather data, to
provide real-time information on air quality (Duke University, 2021;
Zheng et al., 2021). These algorithms can identify pollution sources,
D.B. Olawade et al. Hygiene and Environmental Health Advances 12 (2024) 100114

estimate pollution levels, and recommend actions to minimize air
pollution by learning to recognize patterns and trends in the data.
In recent times, commonly employed AI algorithms for air quality
analysis and prediction include Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Deep
Neural Networks (DNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Fuzzy
Logic. However, the choice of AI model largely depends on the required
information and the nature of air pollutants in the area. For example, a
systematic review by Masood and Ahmad (2021) classified AI-based air
pollution forecasting tools considering factors such as performance,
input parameters, and the relative frequency of application of AI techniques. They concluded that the best-performing tool for AI-based
environmental monitoring is the DNN. On the other hand, Dobrea
et al. (2020) compared other AI-oriented techniques/models for air
pollutants and suggested Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) as the best-performing
techniques for time series analysis of Particulate Matter (PM) with a
diameter <10 m and diameter <2.5 m. It is important to note that PM is
considered in the study as it significantly affects health.
Another study by Subramaniam et al. (2022) suggested that hybrid
models have better performance for environmental monitoring policy
and decision-making. Hybrid models combine the
properties/advantages of two AI algorithms or methodologies to make
informed decisions about future implications of air pollutants. This has
also been confirmed by Fu et al. (2023), who found that hybrid AI
models are more dependable for air quality forecasting.
AI for air quality monitoring offers several advantages over conventional techniques. AI-based systems can analyze enormous volumes
of data from numerous sources and present a comprehensive picture of
air quality in real-time, enabling officials to make informed decisions
and act quickly to reduce air pollution (Chowdhury and Sadek, 2012). AI
systems can also collect and analyze data with higher accuracy and
precision compared to conventional approaches, reducing the possibility
of errors and inconsistencies in air quality data. Furthermore, AI algorithms can provide tailored solutions for various pollution sources and
regions. By analyzing data from specific places and sources, AI can offer
customized air pollution solutions, such as regulating traffic flow,
streamlining industrial processes, or altering urban planning
(Ortega-Fernandez, ´ 2020; Subramaniam et al., 2022).
AI-based recommendations can play a critical role in air quality
monitoring by providing actionable insights to mitigate pollution
(Alloghani, 2023; Neo et al., 2023). For example, AI algorithms can
recommend changes in traffic patterns during peak pollution hours to

reduce emissions, suggest optimal times for industrial operations to
minimize environmental impact, and identify green zones where
pollution levels are within safe limits (Boukerche et al., 2020; Degas
et al., 2022). These recommendations help authorities implement timely
interventions, ensuring that air quality remains within acceptable limits
and public health is protected.
There are several applications for AI-based air quality monitoring
across various industries. Urban management and planning are key
applications where AI algorithms analyze data on air quality, traffic
patterns, and urban development to create specialized solutions for
reducing air pollution in urban areas (Nandini and Fathima, 2019;
Delavar et al., 2019; Jasim et al., 2020). For example, AI can recommend
changes to traffic flow patterns to reduce congestion and air pollution or
modifications to urban planning to improve air circulation and lower
exposure to pollutants. In industrial operations, AI algorithms can
analyze emissions data and suggest modifications to lower pollution
levels, such as adopting more eco-friendly materials and energy sources
or optimizing production processes to minimize waste and emissions
(Alpan and Sekeroglu, 2020). Public health can also benefit from
AI-based air quality monitoring. By evaluating data on air quality and
health outcomes, AI algorithms can identify at-risk groups and create
tailored interventions to promote public health (Masood and Ahmad,
2021; Subramaniam et al., 2022). For instance, AI systems can recommend changes to public transit routes to lessen vulnerable groups’
exposure to contaminants. Table 4 provides a summary of past studies
where AI was employed for air quality monitoring.
Water quality monitoring
Human survival depends on water, and the quality of that water is
crucial for maintaining public health and safety. However, several factors, including pollution, climate change, and population increase,
threaten water quality (Ahmed et al., 2020). Conventional methods of
water quality monitoring rely on labor-intensive, expensive, and
scope-restrictive manual sampling and laboratory analysis. Furthermore, achieving a reliable prediction through conventional methods
requires lengthy processing times and large computational efforts, often
associated with human error (Hameed et al., 2017). A promising
approach to overcoming these limitations and supplying precise,
real-time water quality monitoring is AI (Pappu et al., 2017). Machine
learning algorithms examine data from various sources, including
weather data, historical records, and water quality sensors, to find
patterns and trends that may suggest changes in water quality (Marcin,
2023). AI algorithms can be trained to recognize minute changes in
water quality, such as variations in temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen
levels, and the presence of pollutants, which may indicate pollution or
other abnormalities in water quality.
Various studies on water quality using specific AI techniques have
proposed artificial neural networks (ANNs) as highly effective with
high-performance accuracy in determining different water quality variables in an aquatic environment over a particular period, often referred
to as the Water Quality Index (WQI) (Hameed et al., 2017; Gaya et al.,
2020). A similar study by Wang et al. (2019) described how future
changes in water quality can be accurately predicted, emphasizing understanding the characteristics and point sources of water pollutants.
The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) AI model was employed and
indicated that water quality is affected in different ways and characterized by various point sources of pollutants in the water body. Aldhyani et al. (2020) suggested an artificial neural network model,
specifically the nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NARNET) and
LSTM, which are advanced AI algorithms for predicting water quality
index and classification, and promising AI tools for water management.
The use of AI to assess water quality has several advantages over
conventional techniques (Chen et al., 2020). AI-based systems can

continuously and instantly monitor water quality, enabling authorities
to immediately identify and address problems with water quality. This
can mitigate the dangers that water contamination poses to public
health and the environment (Aldhyani, 2020; Chen et al., 2020).
Moreover, AI-based systems can analyze enormous amounts of data
from numerous sources, providing a comprehensive picture of changes
in water quality (Chowdhury and Sadek, 2012). This capability aids in
identifying trends and patterns in water quality, forecasting future issues, and developing targeted interventions to address these problems
(Wu, 2019; Liu et al., 2019). AI-based recommendations can also guide
timely actions to mitigate water quality issues. For instance, AI can
suggest optimal times for water treatment interventions or recommend
specific pollutant control measures based on real-time data (Nova, 2023;
Rajitha et al., 2024). AI algorithms can create targeted interventions,
such as treatment plans or pollution prevention methods, to lower the
risks and impacts of these issues by analyzing data from specific regions
and types of water quality problems (Khan, 2016; Wagle et al., 2020;
Zhu et al., 2022).
Monitoring water quality with AI has several applications across
various industries. Water management and treatment is one of the key
applications. AI algorithms can assess data on water quality and provide
specialized solutions for water treatment and management, such as
filtration systems or chemical treatment strategies, to reduce the risks
and effects of water quality problems. Agriculture and food production
also benefit from AI-based water quality monitoring. AI algorithms can
assess water quality data and create specialized irrigation and crop
management strategies to mitigate water quality issues. For example,
irrigation schedules can be optimized, and crops that are less susceptible
to water pollution can be chosen. Environmental preservation and
conservation can also benefit from AI-based water quality monitoring.
AI algorithms can create specialized solutions for pollution control and
habitat protection to save aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity by
analyzing data on water quality and environmental conditions (Wagle
et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2022).
Several studies have investigated the application of AI in surface
water quality monitoring and other water quality monitoring tasks. AI
models have been employed for various tasks, including parameter
prediction, anomaly detection, and classifying water samples. One
study, for instance, used deep learning models to forecast water quality
variables such as pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. Another study
categorized water samples according to their quality using a decision
tree algorithm. Many AI models, including deep learning, decision trees,
support vector machines, and artificial neural networks, have been
utilized in these studies (Ahmed et al., 2019; Aldhyani, 2020).
Depending on the purpose and the type of model used, different input
parameters are applied. For example, some studies have utilized
chemical factors like dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand,
and total nitrogen, while others have employed physical measures like
temperature, pH, and turbidity (El-Chaghaby et al., 2020; Lokman et al.,
2021). Common metrics used in these studies include accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve, though they vary depending
on the task. Data collected through various techniques, including
manual sampling and remote sensing, have been used in studies conducted at different sites, including rivers, lakes, and reservoirs (Deng
et al., 2020). These reviewed studies indicate that AI models can provide
precise and effective solutions for monitoring water quality, with some
models achieving higher accuracy than conventional techniques
(Ortega-Fern´
andez, 2020; Subramaniam et al., 2022).
The key contributions of prior studies include the development of
new AI models for water quality monitoring, the comparison of AI
models with conventional approaches, and the identification of challenges and opportunities for future research. Issues such as the lack of
standards in data collection and processing and the limited availability
of high-quality data need to be resolved. Future studies should focus on
creating more robust AI models capable of handling multiple data
sources and delivering precise forecasts for a variety of water quality
indicators. Table 5 provides a summary of instances where AI was
employed for water quality monitoring.
Soil monitoring
The application of AI in soil monitoring represents a significant
advancement in agricultural management, environmental conservation,
and land-use planning (Abdulraheem et al., 2023). Traditional soil
monitoring methods, which involve manual sampling and laboratory
analysis, are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and limited in
scope. AI, however, offers innovative solutions that enhance accuracy,
efficiency, and scalability, revolutionizing how soil health is monitored
and managed (Fuentes-Penailillo ˜ et al., 2024; Jeffrey and Bommu, 2024;
Sharma et al., 2023).
Machine learning algorithms such as Random Forests and Decision
Trees have proven to be particularly effective in handling complex
datasets with numerous variables. These algorithms predict soil properties like moisture content, nutrient levels, and pH by analyzing large
volumes of data from various sources (Folorunso et al., 2023; John et al.,
2020). For instance, the use of Random Forests in the study of soil
organic carbon stocks has shown improved accuracy compared to
traditional statistical methods (Wang et al., 2020). Support Vector Machines (SVM) are employed for soil classification tasks, helping categorize soil types based on physical and chemical properties. These
machine learning techniques enable more precise soil health assessments and informed decision-making in soil management (Padarian
et al., 2020).
Deep learning models also play a crucial role in soil monitoring.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used for image-based soil
analysis. By processing images from satellites or drones, CNNs can
identify patterns related to soil health, erosion, and contamination
(Feizizadeh et al., 2021; Hosseini et al., 2023). For example, drones
equipped with multispectral and hyperspectral cameras capture
high-resolution images of the soil, and AI algorithms process these images to assess soil health and detect issues such as nutrient deficiencies
or pest infestations. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are utilized for
time-series analysis of soil data, predicting changes in soil properties
over time based on historical data (Bai et al., 2022; Park et al., 2023).
These deep learning models offer advanced predictive capabilities that
enhance the proactive management of soil health.
The integration of IoT and smart sensors further amplifies the capabilities of AI in soil monitoring (Rajak et al., 2023). IoT-enabled smart
sensors deployed in the field continuously monitor soil conditions,
including moisture levels, temperature, and nutrient content. These
sensors collect real-time data, which AI algorithms analyze to provide
actionable insights. Specific examples include platforms like the Arable
Mark 2, an IoT device that integrates weather, soil, and crop data to give
comprehensive insights into field conditions (Alahmad et al., 2023).
Additionally, platforms such as the John Deere Operations Center
leverage AI to integrate sensor data and provide real-time recommendations for soil management practices (Ahmad et al., 2023; Nichols
et al., 2022).
The benefits of AI in soil monitoring are substantial. AI-powered
sensors and IoT devices enable continuous, real-time monitoring of
soil conditions, allowing farmers and land managers to make timely
decisions based on current soil health data (Fuentes-Penailillo ˜ et al.,
2024; Reddy et al., 2024). The precision of AI algorithms significantly
reduces human error, leading to more accurate predictions of soil
properties. The scalability of AI solutions allows for comprehensive soil
health assessments across large agricultural areas or regions, which is
particularly beneficial for large-scale farming operations (Chaterji et al.,
2020). AI models’ predictive insights enable proactive soil management,
such as adjusting irrigation schedules, optimizing fertilizer application
(Elshaikh et al., 2024; Hassan et al., 2022; Veeramanju, 2024), and
implementing erosion control measures, enhancing the sustainability
and productivity of agricultural practices (Ruiz et al., 2023; Sachithra
D.B. Olawade et al. Hygiene and Environmental Health Advances 12 (2024) 100114
8
and Subhashini, 2023).
Despite these advantages, the application of AI in soil monitoring
faces challenges. The effectiveness of AI models heavily relies on the
quality and availability of soil data (Grunwald, 2022). Inaccurate or
incomplete data can lead to unreliable predictions, highlighting the
need for robust data collection methods. Additionally, the integration of
AI technologies requires significant initial investments in infrastructure
and training (Aldoseri et al., 2023; Whang et al., 2023). However, the
long-term operational costs are generally lower than traditional
methods due to automation and reduced need for manual labor.
Addressing these challenges will be crucial for fully realizing AI’s potential in soil monitoring and ensuring its widespread adoption.
Overall, AI’s application in soil monitoring exemplifies how
advanced technologies can transform traditional agricultural and environmental practices. By leveraging machine learning, deep learning, and
IoT technologies, AI provides precise, real-time, and scalable solutions
for monitoring soil health (Fuentes-Penailillo ˜ et al., 2024; Shaikh et al.,
2022). As the technology continues to evolve, it promises to offer even
greater insights and efficiencies, contributing to more sustainable and
productive land management practices (Lakshmi and Corbett, 2020;
Nishant et al., 2020).
Human monitoring and epidemiological investigation of
environmental pollutants
The application of AI in human monitoring and epidemiological investigations related to environmental pollutants has shown remarkable
promise, offering precise, timely, and actionable insights into the effects
of pollutants on human health (Akinosho, 2024; Rane et al., 2024).
These advanced technologies facilitate more effective interventions and
inform policy decisions, significantly enhancing public health outcomes
(Wallace et al., 2020).
AI-powered models are instrumental in predicting disease outbreaks
related to environmental pollution by analyzing extensive datasets that
include air and water quality measurements, meteorological data, and
health records (Adefemi et al., 2023). Machine learning algorithms, such
as Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines, have been
employed to predict respiratory and cardiovascular diseases caused by
air pollution (Kothandaraman et al., 2022; Ravindra et al., 2023). For
instance, IBM Watson Health has been utilized in various healthcare
settings to analyze environmental data and predict health risks,
providing early warnings to healthcare providers and the public (Azzi
et al., 2020; Computing). These early warning systems enable timely
interventions that can prevent disease outbreaks and reduce the burden
on healthcare systems.

Moreover, AI tools play a crucial role in assessing human exposure to
environmental pollutants and analyzing their health impacts. Deep
learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), can process vast amounts of data
from wearable sensors, satellite imagery, and medical records to estimate individual exposure levels and correlate them with health outcomes (Eskandari et al., 2021; Ghosh and Kumar, 2022). The Air Quality
Egg project, for example, integrates IoT sensors and AI algorithms to
monitor air quality in real-time, offering personalized exposure assessments and health recommendations (Omidvarborna et al., 2021; Tanveer et al., 2024). This level of granular analysis helps identify vulnerable
populations and inform targeted public health interventions.
Epidemiological surveillance has also been significantly enhanced by
AI through the automation of data collection and analysis processes
(Agbehadji et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2021). This automation makes it
possible to detect patterns and trends that might be overlooked by
traditional methods. Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms can
analyze unstructured data from social media, health forums, and news
articles to identify potential outbreaks linked to environmental pollution
(Al-Garadi et al., 2022; Baclic et al., 2020). Tools like HealthMap utilize
NLP and machine learning to track disease outbreaks globally, providing
real-time surveillance and early detection of environmental health
threats (Choubey and Naman, 2020; Gupta and Katarya, 2020; Jia et al.,
2020; Kamel Boulos and Geraghty, 2020). This capability enables rapid
response and containment measures, mitigating the impact of pollutants
on public health.
In addition to real-time monitoring and surveillance, AI-powered
predictive analytics can inform policy and decision-making by forecasting the long-term health impacts of environmental pollutants
(Chauhan et al., 2024; Fan et al., 2023). By integrating historical data on
pollution levels, health outcomes, and demographic information, AI
models can simulate various scenarios and predict future health trends
(Masood and Ahmad, 2021). This predictive capability is invaluable for
policymakers designing regulations and interventions to reduce pollution and protect public health. The European Air Quality Portal, for
example, uses AI to assess the impact of policy measures on air quality
and public health (Kaginalkar et al., 2021; Rovira et al., 2020),
providing evidence-based recommendations for regulatory actions.
AI-driven health monitoring systems can also provide real-time alerts
to individuals about their exposure to harmful environmental pollutants
(Popescu et al., 2024). Wearable devices equipped with AI algorithms
can continuously monitor physiological parameters such as heart rate,
respiratory rate, and skin temperature, correlating these with environmental data to detect early signs of health deterioration due to pollution
exposure (Natarajan et al., 2020; van Goor et al., 2022). Devices like
Fitbit and Apple Watch have integrated AI capabilities to offer health
insights and alerts based on environmental conditions, enabling users to
take preventive actions to safeguard their health (Mirmomeni et al.,
2021; Yoon et al., 2020).
Despite the numerous benefits, the application of AI in human
monitoring and epidemiological investigations faces several challenges
and ethical considerations. Data privacy and security are paramount, as
the collection and analysis of personal health and environmental data
involve sensitive information (Gabriel, 2023). Ensuring robust data
protection measures and transparent data usage policies is essential to
maintaining public trust. Additionally, the risk of algorithmic bias must
be mitigated by using diverse and representative datasets in model
training. Establishing ethical frameworks and guidelines to govern the
use of AI in public health is crucial, balancing the benefits of technology
with the protection of individual rights.
Benefits of AI-based environmental monitoring
When compared to conventional methods, using AI for environmental monitoring has a number of advantages. First, AI-based environmental monitoring systems have the capacity to evaluate enormous
volumes of data from numerous sources, giving an accurate picture of
the state of the environment in real time (Zhang et al., 2021). This enables authorities to decide wisely and act quickly to protect both the
environment and the general population. Furthermore, by automating
the processes of data collection and analysis, AI-based environmental
monitoring systems can lower the cost of monitoring programs (Chang,
2019; Himeur et al., 2022). This can save significant resources and allow
environmental monitoring programs to grow in scope and scale. With
less chance of errors and inconsistencies, AI-based environmental
monitoring systems can collect and analyze data with better accuracy
and precision than conventional approaches.
Notwithstanding the advantages of AI-based environmental monitoring, a number of issues need to be resolved in order to assure its
successful adoption. The quality of the data used for analysis represents
one of the major obstacles. For AI systems to make precise predictions
and choices, they need accurate and trustworthy data (Hameed et al.,
2017). Inadequate data quality can result in inaccurate predictions and
judgments, which can have a negative impact on the environment and
public health. The availability of data presents another difficulty. It is
challenging to construct precise and trustworthy AI-based monitoring
systems since many regions of the world lack adequate data on environmental factors. In addition to technological constraints, political and
economic issues can also have an impact on the availability of data. The
ethical implications of AI-based environmental monitoring must also be
taken into account. The application of AI for environmental monitoring
raises concerns regarding data ownership, privacy, and the possibility of
data misuse. To ensure the ethical use of AI for environmental monitoring, ethical standards, and regulations must be developed.
Potential environmental impact of AI models in environmental
monitoring
While the benefits of AI models in environmental monitoring are
significant, it is essential to look out for unintended environmental
consequences. AI technologies, particularly those involving extensive
computational processes, can have considerable environmental footprints that must be carefully managed to ensure overall sustainability.
One of the primary concerns is the substantial energy consumption
associated with training and operating AI models (Bloomfield et al.,
2021). Data centres that support AI computations consume vast amounts
of electricity, often sourced from non-renewable energy (Rostirolla
et al., 2022). This high energy usage can lead to increased carbon
emissions, counteracting the positive impacts that AI applications might
have in monitoring and mitigating environmental issues. Recent reports
from major tech companies underscore this issue. Google’s efforts to
reduce its climate footprint are being undermined by its increasing
reliance on energy-intensive data centres to power its new AI products
(Milmo, 2024). According to Google’s annual environmental report, its
greenhouse gas emissions have surged by 48 % over the past five years,
with electricity consumption by data centres and supply chain emissions
being primary contributors (Google, 2024). In 2023 alone, Google’s
emissions rose by 13 % compared to the previous year, reaching 14.3
million metric tons of CO2e, up from 9.7 million metric tons in 2019.
Similarly, Microsoft’s 2024 environmental report highlighted a substantial increase in greenhouse gas emissions, particularly Scope 3
emissions, which grew by over 30 % due to the expansion of data centres
and increased consumption of hardware components necessary for their
AI research (Microsoft, 2024). Although Microsoft managed to reduce its
Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 6.3 % compared to 2020, the rise in Scope 3
emissions emphasizes the environmental challenges posed by AI
infrastructure.
Moreover, the hardware used in AI, including servers and data
storage systems, requires manufacturing processes that often involve the
extraction of rare earth elements (REE) and other non-renewable resources (Gundeti et al., 2023). For example, rare minerals like Erbium,
Holmium, Terbium, Gadolinium, Lanthanum, and Europium are vital in
D.B. Olawade et al. Hygiene and Environmental Health Advances 12 (2024) 100114
10
the manufacturing of optical fibre, capacitors, HD drives, and semiconductors, among other materials (Leal Filho et al., 2023). The associated extraction and processing phases can lead to environmental
degradation, especially at end-of-life (landfilling, incineration, and open
dumping), resulting. into ecological damage, soil and water pollution,
and increased carbon footprints (Balaram, 2019). During extraction, the
machinery used generates significant dust, emissions, and wastes (such
as radioactive elements and other heavy metals), which could easily
dissipate, leading to long-term environmental damage (Willenbacher,
2022). For example, it was estimated that 63,000 m3 of sulfuric and
hydrofluoric acid residues and 1.4 tons of radioactive waste were
generated from refining one ton of REE oxide in China (Willenbacher,
2022). This has resulted in a push for eco-friendly approaches for mineral extraction and processing, as well as discouraging single use of
extracted metals (Nwaila et al., 2022).
In conclusion, while AI models offer significant advancements in
environmental monitoring, their potential environmental impacts must
be diligently managed. Future research and policy-making should focus
on creating frameworks that ensure the sustainable use of AI technologies, maximizing their benefits while minimizing their ecological
footprints.
Limitations and future scope
While the application of AI in environmental monitoring has
demonstrated significant potential, several limitations must be
addressed to realize its full benefits. One prominent limitation is the
dependency on high-quality and extensive datasets (Olawade et al.,
2024a). AI models require large volumes of accurate and representative
data to train effectively, and the availability of such data can be a significant constraint. Additionally, data biases can result in skewed predictions and perpetuate existing inequalities, underscoring the need for
careful data curation and preprocessing.
Overfitting is another critical challenge, where models perform
exceptionally well on training data but fail to generalize to new, unseen
data. Balancing model complexity to avoid overfitting while still
capturing intricate patterns in the data is an ongoing challenge in AI
development. Furthermore, the interpretability of AI models, especially
deep learning models, remains a vexing issue (Olawade et al., 2024b).
These models often operate as "black boxes," making it difficult to understand and trust their decisions, which is particularly crucial in
high-stakes fields like environmental monitoring.
Resource intensiveness is another constraint, as training and
deploying sophisticated AI models demand substantial computational
resources. This requirement can be a barrier for smaller organizations
and developing countries, limiting their ability to leverage AI technologies effectively. Ethical concerns also pose significant challenges, with
AI models potentially reinforcing biases present in training data
(Olawade et al., 2023). Ensuring fairness and addressing ethical implications is crucial, especially in applications where equitable outcomes
are essential.
Security risks, including susceptibility to adversarial attacks, where
small, carefully crafted changes to input data can deceive the model, are
a growing concern. Ensuring the robustness and security of AI models
against such attacks is imperative. Additionally, the environmental
impact of large-scale AI training, which consumes significant energy
resources and contributes to carbon emissions, is becoming increasingly
evident. Developing more energy-efficient AI solutions is necessary to
mitigate this impact.
Despite these challenges, the future scope of AI in environmental
monitoring is promising. Advancements in AI algorithms, improved data
collection techniques, and increased computational power are expected
to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of AI models. Future research
should focus on developing robust AI models that can handle diverse and
complex environmental data, improving model interpretability, and
addressing ethical and security concerns. Collaborative efforts between
researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders will be essential to
foster responsible innovation and ensure the equitable application of AI
in environmental monitoring.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the integration of AI in environmental monitoring
offers transformative benefits across various domains, including soil,
water, and air quality monitoring, traffic management, and carbon
footprint tracking. These advancements contribute significantly to
environmental protection, public health, and sustainable development.
AI’s capability to provide precise predictions and real-time monitoring
enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of environmental management
practices. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential drawbacks
associated with the deployment of AI technologies. One significant
concern is the substantial energy burden imposed by data centres and
the supply chain, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the extraction of resources, such as REEs for AI hardware, results in considerable environmental degradation, including habitat
destruction, soil and water pollution, and toxic waste generation.
The shortage of skilled professionals in the environmental sector,
particularly in the global south, poses another challenge to fully harnessing AI’s potential. Data access, control, and privacy issues must be
addressed to prevent the misuse of AI systems for personal gain, such as
market manipulation or disaster prediction exploitation. Robust data
governance frameworks are essential to mitigate these risks and ensure
equitable and ethical use of AI technologies. Despite these challenges,
the future of AI in environmental monitoring is promising. For future
research, there is a critical need to focus on the ethical implications and
environmental impact quantification of AI technologies. Developing
