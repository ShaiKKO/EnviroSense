## TIPS FOR MAXIMIZING AI EFFECTIVENESS

### Tip #1: Precise AI Prompting
When using AI assistants in Fusion 360, be very specific in your requests. For example, instead of asking for "circuit design help," specify "design a solar-powered battery charging circuit using BQ25798 with 20W solar input and 12.8V LiFePO4 battery with temperature compensation."

### Tip #2: Training the AI with Feedback
After receiving AI suggestions, always provide feedback by clicking the thumbs up/down buttons and adding comments. This improves future recommendations.

### Tip #3: Combining AI with Manual Design
Use AI for initial design suggestions and tedious tasks, but apply your engineering judgment for critical design decisions. The best results come from human-AI collaboration.

### Tip #4: Iterative AI Generation
For complex designs, use multiple iterations with the AI. Start with broad requirements, then refine with more specific constraints based on initial results.

### Tip #5: Cloud Computation Strategy
Schedule intensive AI computations (like generative design) during off-hours to maximize productivity. These can take several hours to complete.

## TROUBLESHOOTING AI FEATURES

### Problem: AI Generates Impractical Designs
**Solution:** Review and refine your constraints. Make sure manufacturing constraints match real-world capabilities. Add more specific preservation geometry.

### Problem: AI Component Recognition Issues
**Solution:** Ensure component descriptions in your BOM are detailed and standardized. For custom components, provide reference designs or detailed specifications.

### Problem: Slow AI Processing
**Solution:** Check your internet connection, simplify the complexity of your request, or upgrade your Fusion 360 subscription for priority computing.

### Problem: Unexpected AI Results
**Solution:** Try rephrasing your prompt to be more specific. Break complex requests into smaller, focused tasks. Review your constraint parameters.
