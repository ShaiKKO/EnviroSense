1. Executive Summary
The EnviroSense™ CoastalGuard is TeraFlux Studios' advanced marine monitoring solution designed for the continuous assessment of coastal waters, marine ecosystems, and maritime hazards. Leveraging the proven durability and sensing technology of the Wildland Sentinel platform, the CoastalGuard provides comprehensive monitoring of both water quality and atmospheric conditions to detect early signs of environmental threats including harmful algal blooms, pollution events, and oil spills.
This document provides the complete technical specifications for development, manufacturing, and quality assurance of the EnviroSense™ CoastalGuard system.
1.1 Product Vision
The EnviroSense™ CoastalGuard transforms marine environmental monitoring by providing continuous, real-time assessment of coastal waters through a network of self-sufficient buoy-based monitoring stations. By detecting early warning signs of harmful algal blooms, pollution events, and oil spills—along with monitoring key oceanographic parameters—the system enables proactive intervention before environmental damage becomes severe. This allows coastal managers, conservation organizations, and emergency response teams to implement targeted, evidence-based actions to protect marine ecosystems, public health, and coastal economies.
